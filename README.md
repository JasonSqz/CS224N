# CS224N
This repo serves as a documentation to my learning for Stanford CS224N: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning. I am truly thankful to Stanford , Professor Christopher Manning and the guests for providing this amazing course and make it accessible to public!

The materials are based on the winter 2021 version and will include all five homeworks and one standard course project.

The repo is an on-going process and constantly updated. (Last update: 2022/09/11)

## Motivation 

There are many existing GitHub repos that provide really good answers to the homeworks. However, not all of them provide good explanations and most are based on older versions of the course. I want to share what I have learnt and address some of the problems I faced.
