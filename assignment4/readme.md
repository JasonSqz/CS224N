# Assignment 4

### 1. Challenge: How to train on GPU?
Assignment 4 requires training on GPU provided by Microsoft Azure. The course provided credits and quotas to GPU instances which you will not have if you are self learning the course. There are several ways to get around:

#### 1.1 Use AWS EC2 (Recommended) (Not free but affordable)

To use AWS, you will need apply for an account (credit card required) and create an EC2 GPU instance.

I will provide a somewhat detailed instruction here.


#### 1.2 Use Azure

You can set up your Azure account and you will generally be granted $200 upon registration (Student account $100). Before you can follow the [Azure guide](https://github.com/daviddwlee84/Stanford-CS224n-NLP/blob/master/Assignments/AzureGuide.pdf) to set up your VMs, you probably will find that you have no quotas for any of the GPU instances. You will need to file a request to increase the limit. I had really bad experience on this part and AWS approved my request. So, I just went on using AWS.

#### 1.3 Train locally 

This is mostly plausible for Windows users who have good GPUs. There are many good tutorials online to set up your environments and I will not illustrate here.
